# Three_JS_Project
University Final Project

Here are the website files for my Individual Project that was completed for my final year of University. 

The focus of the project was to create a web app that allowed the user to interact with a 3D animated model
to aid with their practice of Tai Chi. 

I used the JavaScript library THREE.js. I wanted to learn as much as possible during this project and so chose 
an area that was unfamiliar to me. 

The model was created and animated in Blender and exported as an FBX file. 

A key point in the project is the use of the OrbitControls.js file that allows the user to interact with the 
camera that is set in the scene.
